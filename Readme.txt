There will be 3 Exe files in this folder. 

BSS1.EXE = the first version of Rock-paper-scissors :

- just the basics of the classic game. You vs computer. no timer and no max scores.


BSS2.EXE = the final version of our rock paper scissors game:

- There is now a timer of 3 seconds added to each round. once u reach 3 seconds the computer wins a point. We also added images and there is a maximum score
of 10 points per game.



AOE1.EXE = an upgraded version of BSS2. to level up our project we changed to choices to age of empires. now we can choose between 4 characters. 
(knight-bow-sword-javelin). 

- in this version there is a history of end scores. So if you keep playing, after each game when te 10points are reached 
the game will show you a history of previous games. also in game there is a sort of history for each game
to keep track of how many times you and the computer made a specific choice.
